            <p>Gordon Ramsey's scrambled eggs</p>
            <nav>
                <p>In a cold saucepan or small pot with a single handle, crack three eggs and add some salted butter, about a tablespoon per egg. This isnt meant to be had everyday. Over a medium flame stir constantly, occasionally removing the pan from the heat still stirring. the result youd be looking for is a nice nice balance of fluffy and creamy. right before this point remove from heat and stir in an optional creme fraich cooking with residual heat, add chives and serve with roasted mushrooms and cherry tomatoes on the vine. Ideally placed on toast, I gravitate towards rye or whole grain. </p>
